\section{Conclusion}
The hybrid dynamical system approach for feedback control of a power inverter has shown great promise. This project is realizing this new technology as a engineering endeavor to create a viable hardware platform as a solar microinverter. This alternate control topology, compared existing techniques on the market, aims to define a new category of robust renewable inverter solutions.
