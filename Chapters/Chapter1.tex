\section{Motivation}
Global demand for energy - combined with the surging interest in green technologies - has accelerated the need for a highly reliable, cost-efficient, and self-sustained electric power grid. While scientists and engineers everywhere agree that the global dependence on power derived from heat-engines is a primary cause of the climate change phenomena wreaking havoc on our planet, the integration of renewables into the power grid remains a major engineering endeavor. Future energy distribution systems should be capable of interconnecting diverse power sources including fossil and nuclear-fueled generators, as well as renewable sources such as hydropower, wind turbines, and photovoltaic arrays without adversely affecting the stability of power grids. 

While power derived from common thermodynamic cycles can be increased or decreased on-demand, renewable energy sources are dependent on highly variable environmental conditions, and hence, require robust power conversion techniques that can handle unstable and highly varying input power\cite{ricardo}. The focus of this research-oriented senior design project has been to explore the viability of implementing new hybrid control techniques for solar power conversion. This research is of great interest to us, and the public in general, as it may prove to be a valuable addition to the power system designers toolkit for situations necessitating exceptionally clean output with robust stability characteristics in the face of highly variable load and source conditions.

We seek to understand the reported benefits of hybrid control techniques in the application of solar power converters. In particular, the conversion between the non-linear DC output of solar panels to steady AC power used in the grid will be studied. In order to test the techniques which have been described analytically in \cite{ricardo}, the Hybrid Inverter Team, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering, will develop a small-scale power inverter capable of switching between traditional pulse-width modulation and hybrid texhniques. Our development platform will allow for the straightforward comparison between the two. This report is intended to be an exhaustive account of our methodology and research in the pursuit of these goals.

\section{Background}
In order to meet the challenges involved with implementing new hybrid power conversion technologies, we must first understand the current landscape of power inverters, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and then assess how we might improve upon their implementations. To this end, we will undertake a brief overview of the pulse-width modulation technique, the applicability of hybrid control algorithms to the problem of power conversion, and finally, we will briefly review the additional constraints that photovoltaic (PV) sources place on our design. 

\subsection{Square and Modified Square Inverters}
\todo[inline]{Find source of inverter modulation photos}
\label{squareApproach}
Square wave inverters are the simplest method for generating pseudo-sinusoidal outputs using an H-Bridge. They emulate the positive and negative half cycles of a sine with a simple bipolar scheme where the output is given to be either $+V_{dc}$ or $-V_{dc}$ respectively. After a filtering stage the resulting output can appear quite sinusoidal because primarily low frequency components of the square wave have been allowed to pass; however, closer inspection shows that real-world filters struggle to meet the very low cutoff requirements of the square wave inverter while maintainging a reasonable cost or form factor. As we will demonstrate in Chapter \ref{hardware}, the analog components needed to filter near 60Hz are prohibitively large and expensive. Note that the difference between a pure square wave and a modified square wave is the allowance of the zero state determined by the quantity $\alpha$ shown in Figure \ref{modifiedSquare} - this corrseponds to a third state we will call $zero_{vdc}$. Note that the Fourier series of the output is given by 
\begin{equation}
v_0(t)=\sum\limits_{n,odd}V_n\sin{(n\omega_0t)}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
V_n=\frac{4V_dc}{n\pi}cos{(n\alpha)}
\end{equation}
This would add considerably to the complexity of any inverter system seeking to control both parameters simultaneously. The harmonic content can be controlled by varying the quantity $\alpha$, and the amplitude can also be controlled by $\alpha$. With some analysis, it could be shown that the harmonic content or the amlpitude of the output can be controlled, but not both simultaneously unless we have a variable $V_{dc}$ input. This variable input would be add considerable complexity to existing inverter designs.

\caption{A Modified Square Wave Inverter Crudely Emulates the Positive and Negative Half-Cycles of a Sine Wave}
\label{modifiedSquare}
\end{figure}

The `deal-breaker' with the square wave inverter is the fact the the spectral content of the output is particularly rich at all odd harmonics of the fundamental. This means that we are left with a bulk of the harmonic content at the lower registers, which are particularly hard to filter. 

\subsection{Pulse Width Modulation Inverters}
\label{pwmApproach}

Pulse-width modulation (PWM), or bang-bang techniques, are a popular means for taking a fixed input voltage and varying the effective power seen at the output.This is done by rapidly switching the input off and on such that the the output is some fraction of the input including zero and one hundred percent. This fraction corresponds to what is referred to as the duty cycle. If we pair the PWM technique with the ability to drive current bidirectionally, say, through an H-Bridge circuit, we can use this technique to trace out a pseudo-sinusoidal output. PWM inverters are found almost exclusively in one of two flavors: bipolar and unipolar. In bipolar inverters, the H-bridge is allowed to change state directly from $+V_{dc}$ to $-V_{dc}$, whereas in unipolar designs, the H-bridge is not allowed to switch directly from $+V_{dc}$ to $-V_{dc}$. Instead, unipolar inverters switch between from a positive output to zero, or from a negative output to zero.

Compared to square and modified square wave inverters, much of the filtering burden in a PWM inverter is alleviated due to the fact that spectral content is located primarily at the fundamental with harmonics near the frequency of the modulation index of the PWM signal. The modulation index, which is given by $m_f=\frac{f_{tri}}{f_{sin}}$ where $f_{tri}$ is the frequency of the triangular carrier frequency, and $f_{sin}$ is the sinusoidal reference signal. In contrast to the square wave inverters discussed above, with PWM it is possible to vary amplitude and frequency independently. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{bipolarSwitching}
\caption{Bipolar Switching Uses a Triangular Carrier and a Sinusoidal Reference to Change States from Rail to Rail}
\label{bipolar}
\end{figure}

The effective voltage or current is varied by modulating the duration of on-time of a switch. The switch in this case can take the form of a relay, but more commonly in power applications, takes the form of a field-effect transistor (MOSFET) or insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). One can think of this in terms of a common household faucet with only two states, either fully on or off. If we were able to modulate the amount of time that the water flowed from the faucet, clearly we would be able to choose the flow-rate of the water from the two extrema - on or off - to an arbitrary level of precision depending on how fast we were able to turn the faucet on or off. The scenario put forth in the 'kitchen sink' analogy is analogous to the situation we face in a modern power inverter. In this case, we are faced with the challenge of taking a typically fixed input voltage and switching it in such a way that we achieve a close approximation to a sinusoidal output voltage. Given the clear explanation of how PWM techniques can vary from fully on to fully off in the description above, it is easy to see why the PWM approach has become the standard for power inverters. Additionally, today's microcontrollers have extremely sophisticated peripheral modules built specifically for very fast and PWM signal generation, with resolution down to the nanosecond level becoming quite common. 


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{unipolarSwitching}
\caption{Unipolar switching uses a triangular carrier and a sinusoidal reference to change states from either rail to zero, but never from rail to rail.}
\label{unipolar}
\end{figure}

The Fourier analysis for either bipolar or unipolar PWM output signals is not as straightforward as that of the square wave, so a full derivation is saved for Section \ref{fourier}. However, the fact that the harmonic content occurs at multiples of the modulation frequency can be clearly observed in Figure \ref{pwmFourier}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{pwmFourier}
\caption{Fourier spectrum frequency diagram for both bipolar and unipolar pwm inverter control. Note that while the position of harmonics remains unchanged between either, the magnitude will likely differ.}
\label{pwmFourier}
\end{figure}

Although the PWM method for signal modulation has the clear advantages of widespread adoption and ease of implementation, with the widespread adoption of renewable energy in the form of highly local and decentralized micro-grids, we are increasingly faced with the problem of introducing increasing amounts of high-order noise into the power grid. Further, the typical proportional, integral, derivative, or PID methods for control suffer from a `ringing' phenomena in the presence of the input disturbances. This ringing occurs as the controller attempts to correct for disturbances, and in the process overshoots its target. Because this process is not instantaneous, controllers also suffer from a lag in tracking their reference as the controller takes time to rise or fall to compensate for disturbances. In light of these issues with the traditional PWM techniques, we seek to explore alternate strategies for switching that might alleviate the vulnerability to input disturbances and the problem of an unintentionally rich spectrum at the output of PWM power converters. 

\subsection{Hybrid Systems and Hybrid Control}
\label{hybridApproach}
The study of hybrid systems has emerged in recent years as a response to the increasing entanglement of physical systems and computer control. 
Hybrid systems are those that exhibit both continuous and discrete-time dynamics. The system in question, namely the canonical power inverter topology, which is the focus of this research, is an excellent candidate for study under the lens of hybrid control due to the continuous evolution of a linear oscillator - our output filter - and the discrete time dynamics of the switch - in our case, a transistor receiving control signals from a micro. 

We seek to understand how hybrid control might alleviate some of the challenges associated with PWM techniques, a few of which have been outlined above. While a detailed explanation of the hybrid control algorithm is saved for later on in this paper, in a nutshell it has been found that with relatively simple physical models of our system, and the availability of discrete time switching, that we can generate outputs that closely resemble the desired sinusoidal outputs with less switching noise, and with a robust response to highly variable input voltages. For these reasons, we focus this research on the physical realization of such a hybrid system. One of the goals of this paper is to describe the algorithm designed by Jun Chai and Dr. Ricardo Sanfelice in more detail, and outline some of the challenges associated with realizing this implementation on a real world system \cite{ricardo}.

\subsubsection{The Hybrid Pulse Width Modulation Algorithm}
A new hybrid systems based feedback control scheme for generating the switching signals of an H-bridge is being utilized in this inverter as an alternative to PWM signals derived from the comparison of reference sinusoids and triangular carrier waves. Note that we believe it to be a bit of a misnomer to say that this technique is an alternative to PWM; rather, the hybrid controller offers an alternate means for \emph{generating} the pulse-width modulated signal seen at the H-bridge. 
With the hybrid controller AC output stability is achieved by sampling the state of the system and comparing it to the ideal path of a linearly oscillating RLC filter \cite{ricardo}. The hardware implementation of the microinverter in this project will highlight the advantages and disadvantages of hybrid control versus traditional PWM.

\subsection{The Problems with Solar}
With the cost of photovoltaics rapidly decreasing, we have seen a rush toward the adoption of solar micro-grids which seek to exploit the most abundant source of power known to mankind - the sun. However, our heliocentric conundrum dictates that most places on earth receive time-dependent quantities of solar irradiance over the course of any given day. This high variability in the context of power conversion implies major challenges to our modern power grid which guarantees nearly continuous up-time and rock-solid stability. 

Today's renewable power conversion technologies are not robust to highly variable input sources like solar power. Before utilities break ground on large-scale solar farms, complex and costly stability analysis must be done to ensure that the possible energy contribution outweighs the destabilizing effect of megawatts of energy that can be thrown out with a rainstorm or eclipse. Some other challenges with solar include  the problem of shading or partial irradiance of solar arrays, and the non-linear nature of the photovoltaics themselves. This non-linear behavior necessitates the implementation of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms which comprehend this phenomena and harvest the most power from solar sources and inverters over their finite lifespans. This is critical for obtaining the maximum benefit from the non-trivial investment required to operate solar arrays today. 

\section{Approach}
It is widely accepted that distributed generators (DG) and the use of 'smart inverters' have a far less detrimental effect on the stability of the grid than centralized solar production, and can even have a stabilizing effect on the grid. So-called 'microinverter' deployment strategies for solar systems offer improved reliability and potentially reduced installation costs. Widespread integration of microinverters with individual solar panels to form AC power generation units removes single-point failure risks found in common centralized PV inverter arrangements. Microinverters for single panels can have longer mean times between failures since they are often designed for the 200W power range and operate with lower temperatures due to reduced heat waste. The economies of scale for manufacturing many consumer microinverters reduces hardware costs found in building few larger high power PV inverters \cite{microchip}. Another benefit of the microinverter approach is that the feedback mechanisms at work optimize the power generation of every panel in the system by each unit's particular conditions - this makes them robust in situations like partial shading.

\todo[inline]{Ben wrote this paragraph}
Switching power inverters are an enabling technology found in energy conversion systems. Photovoltaic (PV) panels harvest energy from the sun to generate the alternating current (AC) electricity used in the grid. PV arrays output direct current (DC) electricity, thus an inverter is required to generate the versatile AC power used in standard loads as shown in Figure~\ref{solarBlock}. Energy sourced from renewable resources is variable in nature and necessitates feedback controlled electronics to maintain stable power production. This project is focused on delivering a microinverter system as a robust solution for solar power applications. 

Can hybrid techniques for PWM generation handle disturbances more robustly, with less overshoot or rise time than traditional inverters? Can they convert power more efficiently? Can they do it more simply, or for less money? If any combination of these qualities hold for this new process, then we can say definitively that this technique is a viable alternative to the tried and tested PWM techniques prevalent today.
