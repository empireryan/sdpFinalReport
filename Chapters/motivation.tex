\section{Motivation}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} increasing necessity of producing more energy, combined with the surging
interest in green technologies worldwide, has promoted the need for a highly
reliable, cost-efficient, and self-sustained electric power grid. Future energy distribution
systems should be capable of interconnecting diverse power sources,
including fossil and nuclear-fueled generators; renewable sources, such as hydropower
generators, photovoltaic arrays, and wind turbines. In particular, renewable energy sources depend heavily on
rapidly changing environmental conditions, and hence, require robust power conversion techniques with unstable/highly varying input signals\cite{91}. The focus of this research-oriented senior design project has been to explore the viability and technical challenges involved with implementing new hybrid control techniques for solar power conversion. This research is of great interest to us and the public in general as it may prove to be a valuable addition to the power system designers toolkit for situations necessitating exceptionally clean output with robust stability characteristics in the face of highly variable load and source conditions.
